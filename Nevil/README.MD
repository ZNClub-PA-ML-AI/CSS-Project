# SEED algorithm

## Overview

SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) since 1998. It has the Feistel
structure with 16-round and is strong against DC (Differential Cryptanalysis), LC (Linear Cryptanalysis), and related key attacks, balanced with security/efficiency trade-off.


## Features
-  The Feistel structure with 16-round
-  128-bit input/output data block size
-  128-bit key length
-  A round function that is strong against known attacks
-  Two 8x8 S-boxes
-  Mixed operations of XOR and modular addition
