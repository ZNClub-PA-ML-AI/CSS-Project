we have already completed 50% of the encryption phase.

now as the name suggested, BYTE ROTATION ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM right?
block size = matrix size = 16 bytes = 4x4 matrix We use a modulo 4 approach

FORMULA = ROW_NUM % SIZE OF SQUARE MATRIX

1. Cpk -> Chr
2. Chr -> Cvr
3. Cvr -> Ce

SUMMARY:
M->Mp->MpT->
K->Ke----------> +
= Cpk-> Chr  -> Cvr -> Ce

DECRYPTION
